**THIS WORKS ON PLASMA 5**

If your plasma shell becomes unresponsive or you get a black screen, best is to start krunner (ALT+F2) and run one of the following commands.

# RESTART PLASMA SHELL

```
kstart5 plasmashell
```

# RESTART PLASMA SHELL IF THE ABOVE DOESN'T WORK

```
kwin --replace
```

```
kstart kwin --replace
```
